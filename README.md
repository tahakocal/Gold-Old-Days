# Gold-Old-Days

This repository includes my projects that I prepared while I was learning coding on first few months. Each project represents a different stage in my coding journey, showcasing various skills and programming concepts that I learned and practiced. Although these are beginner projects, they reflect my passion for coding and my growth as a developer.

Note: Since these are my very first coding projects, expect to see some "creative" code solutions, interesting naming choices, and plenty of rookie mistakes! ðŸ˜… Think of this as a glimpse into my humble beginnings as a developerâ€”where it all started, messy code and all!
